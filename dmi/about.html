<p>This is <strong>dmi_browser</strong>, a DMI file viewer in your browser.</p>
<p><code>.dmi</code> files are used by the <a href="https://www.byond.com/">BYOND</a> platform to store sprites. They are PNG files with extra metadata in a zTXt chunk. That metadata allows the BYOND platform to properly slice the PNG sprite sheet, and to arrange the individual frames into animations. dmi_browser displays individual frames of the sprite sheet, and animates the sprites marked for animations.</p>
<p>If you need some DMI files to try it, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/tree/dev/icons">Baystation 12's icon files</a>. Baystation 12 is an open source game for the BYOND platform.</p>
